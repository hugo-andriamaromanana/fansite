            </h4>
            <p>
              Jimmy McGill was born on November 12, 1960, to Ruth and Charles
              McGill Sr in Cicero, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. He had one
              older brother, Charles "Chuck" McGill Jr. Jimmy later worked for
              his father at his small corner store and watched as he was
              repeatedly taken advantage of by scam artists. After one of the
              scam artists offered young Jimmy a life lesson about wolves and
              sheep, he began stealing money from his father's cash register
              mostly being rare coins ("Inflatable", "Slip"). Over the following
              years, nearly $14,000 was embezzled from the store either from
              Jimmy or Charles Sr being taken advantage from, which eventually
              led to its closure. Charles Sr died six months later, which Chuck
              secretly blamed on Jimmy presuming that he was the one who
              embezzled the 14k.

            <p>
              In his teenage years, Jimmy began to play his own scams to get
              quick money. In one of his most famous scams, he would find the
              most slippery patches of ice every winter, stage a fall, and earn
              himself a fair amount of money, which earned him the nickname
              "Slippin' Jimmy" ("Uno"). In another one of his scams, Jimmy
              (using the alias "Saul Goodman") worked with his close friend and
              fellow con artist Marco Pasternak to trick others into trading
              cash for fake Rolex watches ("Hero"). Jimmy also produced fake IDs
              for his classmates in high school ("Nailed"). Jimmy apparantly
              used some of the money acquired by scamming to attend bartending
              school but it's unknown if he ever worked as one. One day, circa
              1982, Jimmy attempted to show off while doing a slip-and-fall
              outside the Marshall Field's department store and hit the ice as
              hard as he could, accidentally breaking his knees in the process.

            </h4>
            <p>
              In the early 1990s, Jimmy divorced his first wife when she cheated
              on him with a guy named Chet, who happened to owe Jimmy money. In
              1992, a drunken Jimmy encountered Chet at a local Dairy Queen and
              decided to perform a "Chicago Sunroof" (defecating through the
              sunroof of Chet's car) as revenge. Unbeknownst to him, however,
              Chet's children were in the back seat. Even worse, Chet had ties
              to the local prosecutors. Jimmy was quickly brought in by the
              police on charges of property damage, assault, and and a possible
              sex offense. He was booked and put in pre-trial detention
              ("Marco").

              While Jimmy's friends were delighted by his achievement, Chuck was
              secretly shocked and disgusted at the thought of his ne'er-do-well
              brother practicing law. Refusing to view Jimmy as a real lawyer
              and frustrated that he earned a law degree so easily while Chuck
              himself had to work hard his entire life to build his own career,
              Chuck pressured Howard to block his brother from working at HHM.
              When Howard was forced to deliver the news, Jimmy mistakenly
              blamed him for the decision ("RICO", "Pimento"). Shortly
              thereafter, Jimmy quit HHM to become a solo practitioner. Sometime
              in Chuck's extended leave, Jimmy delivers groceries to Chuck's
              house. Chuck expresses interest in hearing about Jimmy's fledgling
              solo practice; Jimmy clearly finds his clients distasteful, but
              Chuck tells him that even they deserve a good legal defense. Chuck
              seemingly wants a genuine conversation with Jimmy, saying that it
              is not too late for him to change his path, but Jimmy assumes that
              his brother is criticizing him and rebuffs the attempt. After
              Jimmy leaves, Chuck, taking his gas lantern and a copy of H.G.
              Wells' The Time Machine, retreats into his study. ("Saul Gone")

            <p>
              Deciding to go into elder law, Jimmy redesigns his image and dons
              a suit similar to Andy Griffith's on Matlock. He begins
              volunteering at retirement homes, where he helps pass out meals
              (which are stamped with his contact information and ads), hosts
              bingo games, and slowly builds a growing client base ("Bingo").
              When he visits the Sandpiper Crossing retirement home, he learns
              that the workers are grossly overcharging the residents. He
              searches Sandpiper's dumpsters and collects shredded documents as
              evidence ("RICO"). Chuck agrees that Jimmy has built a strong case
              against Sandpiper but tells him to take the case to HHM, since
              they have more resources; Jimmy reluctantly agrees. On the night
              before the brothers are to head to deliver the case to HHM, Chuck
              secretly goes outside and uses Jimmy's phone to call Howard.

              Jimmy begins dreaming about reviving Wexler McGill, and admits to
              Kim that he is not going to see a therapist because he wants to
              move forward. Kim reluctantly accepts the decision. Jimmy heads to
              the Forque Kitchen and Bar for dinner with Kim, where she tells
              him that she has been hired at the head of Schweikart & Cokely's
              banking division. Jimmy wants to practice criminal law and reform
              Wexler McGill, but Kim's plans do not coincide with Jimmy's.
              Although Jimmy realizes his dreams have been dashed, he wishes Kim
              well with her career. Jimmy goes to HHM to collect the $5,000
              inheritance. Jimmy learns HHM is going through a bad spell and
              admonishes Howard for wallowing and not fighting. Howard retorts
              with a "fuck you," and Jimmy tells him to use that rage to his
              advantage. Later, Jimmy takes deliver of a new set of phones at
              Day Spa and Nail, and has to bribe Mrs. Nguyen with one so he can
              keep them in the back room. At night, Jimmy finds the three youths
              who mugged him and offers to cut them in on his business in return
              for leaving him alone. Instead, they threaten him with a
              switchblade, causing Jimmy to run. The youths give chase but find
              themselves in a trap where they are captured and hung up in a
              piñata store. Two masked men, one of whom is Huell Babineaux, bust
              the piñatas while Jimmy warns them about ripping him off again.
              Suitably terrified, Jimmy tells them they have had their warning
              and leaves them hanging. ("Piñata")
