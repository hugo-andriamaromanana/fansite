              Not long after Saul and Walt disappeared, the police and several
              DEA agents entered Saul's office only to find it empty with the
              hole on his wall. Around this time there was also a documentary
              released about Saul, which discussed his connections to Walter
              White and the Cartel. ("American Greed: James McGill"). All of his
              assets were also impounded shortly after his disappearance. ("Wine
              and Roses") After being rescued by Walt from Jack Welker's
              Compound following the gang massacre and moments before Walt's
              death, Jesse seeks out the services of Saul's "disappearer" Ed
              again. Without Saul around to help him, Jesse is forced to figure
              out how to find Ed on his own using the scant information he
              learned when Saul called Ed for him. Ed tells Jesse that he thinks
              Jesse, Walt and Saul all made their own luck after Jesse tries to
              get Ed to help him by telling Ed about his captivity. ("El
              Camino")

              After passing out, Gene is taken to the hospital where he
              undergoes tests to determine the cause of his collapse and if it
              was a heart attack. While at the hospital, Gene grows nervous at
              the sight of police officers nearby and his heart rate increases
              but is visited by a doctor who confirms that it wasn't a heart
              attack and aside from a slightly elevated blood pressure,
              everything came back as normal. On Gene's way out, the nurse at
              the desk asks for another look at his driver's license, further
              worrying Gene. Due to the computer repeatedly kicking the driver's
              license back, she requests Gene's social security number and Gene
              grows more and more fearful of being discovered as time goes on.
              Fortunately, the nurse determines that she keeps making a simple
              typo and Gene is able to leave. Breathing heavily, Gene has a taxi
              take him back to the mall and spots an air freshener marked
              Albuquerque Isotopes in the rear-view mirror and the taxi driver
              appears to be staring at him as if he recognizes him. When the
              driver takes too long at a green light, a paranoid Gene decides to
              get out of the taxi early and heads towards a church, noticing
              that the taxi has not moved since he left it. ("Smoke")

              An elderly woman named Marion rides her mobility scooter around a
              supermarket, shopping for groceries. On her way home, her scooter
              becomes stuck in the snow. She attracts the attention of Gene, who
              helps her out of the snow, snipping a wire off from her scooter to
              ensure he has to manually wheel her home. Jeff, the cab driver,
              arrives home and finds his mother, Marion, chatting it up with
              Gene. Jeff confronts Gene outside his house, knowing he did this
              to get to him. Acknowledging that Jeff didn't blackmail him due to
              his Saul Goodman persona being found out by him, Gene persuades
              Jeff to join "the game".

              Gene takes off from Jeff's house in his car while Marion remains
              in contact with her LifeAlert operator. Returning to his
              residence, he retrieves his shoebox and overhears information
              about his car being broadcast on the police radio frequency.
              Spotting two cops outside, he escapes through a rear window with
              the shoebox and a burner phone. As police swarm Omaha, Gene climbs
              into a dumpster and removes Ed Galbraith's business card from his
              shoebox. As he struggles to open the packaging to the phone,
              however, he spills the contents of the shoebox. He is discovered
              by the cops and surrenders.

            <p>
              Saul is extradited back to Albuquerque and held at the
              Metropolitan Detention Center. As he is being led through a
              corridor, he sees Hank's widow Marie Schrader in an adjoining
              room. Saul and Oakley negotiate a plea with a team of prosecutors,
              who are offering a reduced sentence of 30 years in prison. Knowing
              that Marie is watching the negotiation, Saul asks that she be
              allowed into the room. Marie sits across from Saul and eulogizes
              her late husband, Hank, and his partner, Steven Gomez, blaming
              their murders on Walt. Saul portrays himself as a victim of Walt,
              recounting how he and Jesse kidnapped him; his actions as their
              accomplice, he insists, were borne out of fear that he would be
              killed. Saul coolly reminds the lead prosecutor, George
              Castellano, that he only needs one juror to avoid conviction;
              Marie warns against making a deal.

              Jimmy is transported by bus to ADX Montrose. One of the prisoners
              on the bus, sitting in front of Jimmy, initially threatens him but
              quickly recognizes him as Saul Goodman; despite Jimmy insisting
              that his name is "McGill", the other prisoners recognize him one
              by one. Eventually the prisoners use the "Better Call Saul" slogan
              as the basis of a chant. Jimmy smiles, amused. He later becomes a
              local celebrity within the prison for his past life as Saul,
              befriending several inmates. Later, while he is fixing food in the
              prison kitchen, Jimmy is told that a lawyer has come to see him.
              Taken to a visitation room, he finds that the lawyer is Kim; as
              her membership card with the New Mexico Bar Association doesn't
              have an expiration date, she is allowed to visit him as an
              attorney. Evoking their talks together in the HHM parking garage,
              the two share a cigarette and lean against a wall. The two discuss
              Jimmy's sentence and how he had almost gotten seven years instead
              before his confession. As she walks out of the prison, Kim sees
              Jimmy watching her from the exercise yard. The two look longingly
              at each other through the barbed-wire fences; he gives her a
              pointed-gun gesture. Kim steals one last glimpse of Jimmy as she
              turns a corner of the prison. ("Saul Gone")
