              In the years spanning 2005 to 2007, Saul eventually coined “Better
              Call Saul!” as his famous catchphrase and begins an aggressive
              marketing strategy, filming several low-budget, late night TV ads,
              recording radio ads, and putting ads featuring his likeness on
              benches and billboards all over Albuquerque. This caused Saul to
              become a local celebrity, recognized by a wide range of
              Albuquerque citizens, including criminal civilians (some of which
              would become his clients), as well as regular civilians (e.g.
              Walter White Jr.). Saul regularly sleeps with sex workers and
              begins sexually harassing his secretary Francesca, whom he has
              made complicit in his crimes.

              Jesse takes Walt to Saul's law office at a strip mall. At Jesse's
              request, having previously been convinced by Kim to trust Saul as
              a lawyer, Walt and Jesse decide to hire him as their lawyer, with
              Jesse explaining to a hesitant Walt that they do not need a
              criminal lawyer (a lawyer who defends criminals), but a criminal
              lawyer (a lawyer who is also a criminal). Walt loses a coin toss
              to determine who will go into Saul's office and pay his retainer
              fee. Upon entering the office, Walt introduces himself as Badger's
              uncle "Mr. Mayhew". Saul reports that the DEA wants Badger to lead
              them to a mystery man named Heisenberg. Saul initially insists on
              making Badger give up Heisenberg, but seems to reconsider when
              Walt offers him $10,000. Walt has another coughing fit. Upon
              returning to Jesse's car, Walt reports that Saul kicked him out of
              the office for trying to bribe him.

              Later that night, Jesse and Walt don their ski masks, kidnap Saul,
              and haul him to a freshly dug shallow grave in a desert wasteland.
              A terrified Saul presumes that the situation has to do with Lalo's
              promise that he will be back for answers about what Jimmy knows of
              Nacho's actions, Saul desperately shouts at the two men that "it
              wasn't me it was Ignacio, he's the one!" and asks if Lalo sent
              them. However, when Jesse demands that he speak English, a
              relieved Saul realizes that they have nothing to do with Lalo,
              with Jesse being confused as to who Saul is talking about. Jesse
              tells him he should've taken Badger's offer. Saul informs them
              that he doesn't take bribes from strangers. Jesse, gun aimed at
              Saul, instructs him to give Badger "the best legal representation
              ever," but says that Saul is dead if anyone snitches to the DEA.
              Saul suggests killing Badger, but Jesse insists that's not an
              option.

              Later on, Saul gives Walt a tutorial on money laundering. After
              all the costs associated with Badger’s arrest, he only has $16,000
              left. Walt lets on that he might not have much longer to live, but
              he intends to cook a lot more. ("4 Days Out"). After one of Walt
              and Jesse's dealers, Jesse's friend Christian "Combo" Ortega, is
              murdered by an eleven-year old boy under orders from rival dealers
              from a rival gang, Saul proposes new distribution method for Walt
              and Jesse's product. Under stress, Jesse tells Jane that he is a
              drug dealer, though she had already deduced as much. Saul puts
              Walt in touch with a meth distributor named Gus, a cautious yet
              successful businessman who is skeptical of Jesse's dependability
              but agrees to purchase Walt's product. However, Gus expresses
              concern about Jesse's drug problem, which has escalated into
              heroin use due to Jane's relapse. Walt receives a large offer for
              the short-notice delivery of the remainder of their inventory, but
              at the same time receives a call from Skyler, notifying him of her
              imminent labor. ("Mandala")

              Mike waits outside Saul's office while Huell guards the door.
              Inside, Walt and Jesse assuage Saul's doubts about working with
              Mike again, who threatened to break Saul's legs. They let Mike in
              and he lays down ground rules: He runs the business, Walt and
              Jesse cover production. Saul privately asks Walt if he's okay with
              the arrangement, but Walt's unfazed. Saul takes the team on a tour
              of potential new lab venues, but Walt, Jesse, and Mike nix them
              all, spotting logistical problems with each. Jesse and Mike are
              ready to dismiss the final venue, Vamanos Pests, but Walt demurs,
              declaring it's perfect. The next day, the four watch the
              pest-control team as it tents an infested home. Walt explains his
              plan: If they cook inside houses undergoing fumigation, no one
              will bother them or question strange smells. They can hide in
              plain sight. Saul says the pest crew, run by a man named Ira, runs
              a burglary operation on the side and knows how to keep secrets.
              Mike suggests a vote. "Why?" asks Walt: he's already convinced,
              and so is Jesse. ("Hazard Pay")

              After picking Saul up, Ed starts the process of setting him up
              with a new identity in Nebraska, to Saul's obvious displeasure.
              Until he can be safely moved, he has to hole-up in the basement of
              the extractor's shop. To Saul's surprise, he shares the basement
              with Walt, who is also waiting to be extracted out of New Mexico.
              ("Granite State") During their time in the bunker, Saul lies on
              his cot as Walt tries to repair a faulty water heater. Pointing to
              Walt's former occupation as a scientist, Saul asks what he would
              do if he had a time machine. Walt is angrily dismissive of the
              question and recognizes that what Saul is actually talking about
              is past regrets. He says that his biggest regret is allowing his
              former business partners to take over the company he co-founded
              and profit off his discoveries. Saul replies that his biggest
              regret is an experience from his youth in which he hurt his leg in
              a slip-and-fall. Walt, incredulous, states that "you were always
              like this" and returns to fixing the water heater, leaving Saul
              sitting on his cot. ("Saul Gone")
